Name:Yu ZHIHAO
Student ID: 1155141497

Manipulation:
	Key "W": brightness of light increase
	Key "S": brightness of light decrease
	Key "UP": Cat move forward
	Key "Down":Cat move backward
	Key "Left": Cat turn to the left
	Key "Right": Cat turn to the Right
	Key "1": Change the cat texture as texture1
	Key "2": Change the cat texture as texture2
	Key "3": Change the Floor texture as texture1
	Key "4": Change the Floor texture as texture2
                Key "B": Blinn-Phong effect turn on(refer to https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Advanced-Lighting)
                Key "Z": Blinn-Phong effect turn off
	Mouse (left click and drag upward) : whole scene move upward
	Mouse (left click and drag downward) : whole scene move downward
	Mouse (left click and drag to the left) : whole scene rotate left
	Mouse (left click and drag to the Right) : whole scene rotate Right
	Mouse (Scroll forward) : whole scene zoom in
	Mouse (Scroll backward) : whole scene zoom out
                
                Object: Cat, Dog, Penguin and floor
                Lightning: Directional light and point light,while we can control the intensity of directional light
                Offer Texture control,Object control, Light Control and View control
                Offer different types of lighting sources(Directional light and point light)
                Offer a Advanced Lighting called Blinn-Phong, howerver, no too much obvious changes with little specular improvement
